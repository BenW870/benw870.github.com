                <h4>or how I learned to stop worrying and love coding</h4>
                <p>I wanted to build a website. First I found the obvious industry leader: Adobe. Then I saw the price tag for DreamWeaver, Ps, Illustrator, Fireworks, etc etc. Wasn't going to happen. Thinking I could pull this off without actually learning to code, I went to WYSIWYG editors like Kompozer. I did tutorials, used templates, and after alot of work I had a very ugly website I didn't understand.</p>
                <p>At some point I realized that all I needed to do to change the appearance of something on the page was just edit (and by that I mean cut and paste) the css file, save, refresh the browser and BAM! it changed.</p>
                <p>There were other discoveries. I realized most folks would view the site on their tablet or phone, so the site had to be responsive. Also the web is in transition to new standards in HTML5 and CSS3. These are good things. Learning how to design without the baggage of past methods gives a novice designer a leg up. While Adobe's products are super powerful, they are also a crutch and can be time suck on your workflow.</p>
                <p>First thing I did was to get a subscription to <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/">Treehouse</a>. Its worth the money (20$ a month) but it isn't necessary. There are other training web sites that are just as good and the web is full of all kinds of tutorials to teach you HTML</p>
                <p>Next step is getting the necessary tools. A text editor is a must. At the end of the day, they are nothing but fancy notepads, but the features they bring are invaluable. I use <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2">Sublime Text</a>. Its available for win, mac, and linux. Vim and Mozilla's Bluefish are good too. An inspector is another necessary. The <a href="https://getfirebug.com/">Firebug Firefox plug-in is what I use. Google Chrome has similar development tools.</p>
                <p>CSS frameworks is what really got me going. They are like modular templates of sorts. Typography, layouts, components like navbars, and javascript plug ins. I have the most experience with <a href="http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/">Twitter BootStrap</a> and <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Zurb Foundation 4</a>. Right now, Foundation is somewhat better because they have embraced a "mobile first" method. Basically they design for the smallest width screens and then start figuring out larger ones. Believe me, its easier than the other way. That advantage will be short lived since the upcoming Twitter BootStrap 3 will be doing the same. Twitter also has a HUGE community and tons of resources available. I'm using a beta build of BS3 in anticipation of the new release.</p>
                <p>Boilerplates are good too, specifically the <a href="http://html5boilerplate.com/">HTML5 Boilerplate</a>. It provides a delete-key-friendly starting point that has tons of best practices that will make you look like a pro. You can easily combine H5BP with bootstrap using <a href="http://www.initializr.com/">Initializr</a>.</p>
                <p>For getting started, consider <a href="http://www.divshot.com/">Divshot</a> or <a href="https://jetstrap.com/">Jetstrap</a>. They are browser based WYSIWYG editors built around frameworks. You can drag and drop components into a page or template and it can export flawless sexy html and css code.</p>
				<p>If you are already down the road with WordPress, there are ways to make use of Bootstrap and other frameworks or just to make it responsive.
				<ul>
					<li><a href="http://320press.com/wpbs/">Bootstrap + WP</li>
					<li><a href="http://wordpress.org/themes/responsive">a responsive theme</a></li>
				</ul>
				</p>
				<p>At the end of the day, the most important lesson has been truly learning how the web is put together. Its all just code, a language, math and it can be mastered.</p>
